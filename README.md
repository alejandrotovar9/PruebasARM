# PruebasARM
Testing STM32F4 Discovery Board to acquire acceleration data from an MPU6050 taking the data from the registers according to the datasheet and then printing continuosly on the serial port using USART2 and I2C2 ports.

The acceleration can be plotted using VS Code extension Teleplot if the following convention is used: ">Data title: Data\r\n"
